# Colorado Motor Vehicle Sales Analysis

## 📌 Project Name
**Colorado Motor Vehicle Sales Analysis (EDA & Trend Insights)**

---

## 📄 Project Description
This project analyzes motor vehicle sales data across different counties in Colorado using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques. The dataset is structured by **year, quarter, county, and total sales value**.

The goal of this project is to identify **sales trends, seasonal patterns, and regional performance** through data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization. Machine learning techniques are intentionally not applied due to limited feature availability, allowing the focus to remain on **clear, interpretable business insights**.

This project is suitable for **Data Analyst** and **Finance Analyst** roles.
